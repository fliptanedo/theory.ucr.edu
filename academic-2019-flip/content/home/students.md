Prospective graduate students should [review these lectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04228).

I am currently not taking new PhD students, but welcome inquiries about joining the [UCR Particle Theory Group](http://theory.ucr.edu). We are committed to inclusion and I especially encourage women and under-represented minorities to consider our group.
