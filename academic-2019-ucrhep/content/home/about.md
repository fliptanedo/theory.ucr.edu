<!-- # Biography -->

Our group focuses on particle and astro-particle physics beyond the Standard Model. We focus on theories and signatures of dark matter, neutrinos, and cosmology. Our specialties include self-interacting dark matter, neutrino flavor symmetries, baryogenesis, collider searches of new physics, and models of Higgs naturalness.
